</div>

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

* A device which supports [webgl](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) and [webrtc](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream) with a working camera input.
* Internet connection.
* A web browser such as Google Chrome.

### Try it on mobile

It works on all platforms. Android, iOS and Windows phone. It runs on **any browser with WebGL and WebRTC** (for iOS, you need to update to iOS 11).

Try on your phone in only two easy steps, check it out!

1. Open any [marker image from here](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) in your browser.
2. Open my [augmented reality web app](https://liyasthomas.github.io/lvr/) in your phone browser. Give permissions to access camera. Scan marker image with your camera.

You are done! It will open a web page which read the phone webcam, localize a marker and add 3D on top of it.
